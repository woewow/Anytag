Figure 1| A schematic overview of the sequencing and tag-free local assembly.  (a) Genomics DNA was extracted from D. melanogaster. (b) gDNA was randomly sheared into a smear of DNA fragments, and separately sent to library preparation. (c) After paired-end sequencing, read pairs with continuous insert sizes were generated. (d) Virtual layout of read pairs.  Long read pairs were drawn in blue, while others in black.  A process of local assembly was illustrated between two vertical purple dashed lines.  Read pairs with the potential to fill in internal gap were shown in blod.  A serial of arrawed lines demonstrated the path of long sequence construction.  (e) Long sequences randomly laid on genome as the original long read pairs.
